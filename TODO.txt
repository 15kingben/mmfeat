If you are looking to contribute, feel free to do any of these things:

- Give freesound miner its own saveFile method
- Make the miners and other things multiprocessed
- Add BoCC model
- Unit tests
- Installer script (setup.py)
- Add more demos, e.g.:
  -- Classifying documents multi-modally
  -- Doing BLI (needs avgmax and maxmax sim functions in mmfeat.space.sim)
  -- Simple cross-modal mappings
  -- Etc.
